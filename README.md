Digital_Image_Encryption_Using_RSA_and_Arnold_Cat_map
Digital image encryption is crucial for securing visual data in various applications, from personal privacy to secure communications. The combination of RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption and the Arnold Cat Map provides a robust method for enhancing image security. This approach leverages the strengths of both techniques: RSA's asymmetric encryption for key exchange and the Arnold Cat Map's chaotic transformation for pixel rearrangement.
In this process, we obtain the image from the user and apply the Arnold Cat encryption algorithm. The resulting output image is then encrypted using the RSA algorithm, and the final output is transmitted through the communication channel.
